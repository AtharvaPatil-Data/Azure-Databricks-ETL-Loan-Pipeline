# Azure Databricks ETL Loan Pipeline

Cloud ETL pipeline for **LendingClub 2018Q4** loan data using **Azure Databricks (Spark)**, **ADLS Gen2**, and **Azure SQL**.  
Includes a single Colab/Databricks notebook, project report, and an Azure setup walkthrough with screenshots.

> **Why it’s useful:** cleans messy, semi‑structured finance fields (e.g., `"36 months"`, `%` rates), standardizes types, derives “good/bad” loan flags, and lands curated data in Azure SQL for BI/analytics.
